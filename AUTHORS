This file is now the amalgamated list of authors, contributors and credits
for Doom64 EX. Hopefully by keeping these all in one place, they will remain
more accurate.

Doom was originally written by id software; when playing with any id main
wad file, you can see their list of credits, which includes the list of
programmers. After some years, they released the source code, to allow
others to work on improving the game.

In October 1999, id Software re-released the Doom source code under the
GNU General Public License.
